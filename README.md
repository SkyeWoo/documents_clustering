Our 1st Information Theory group-homework.

We use the dataset ‘AAAI 14 Accepted Papers’ to do the following tasks:

1.	Apply the **relative entropy rule** to cluster different papers into different groups according to their titles, abstracts, keywords.
2.	Besides the relative entropy rule, apply KNN and DBSCAN method to achieve the target in 1.

Note: the dataset ‘AAAI 14 Accepted Papers’ consists of the titles, authors, topics, keywords and abstracts of all accepted papers in AAAI, 2014.
